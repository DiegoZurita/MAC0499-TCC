abstract = {SQL Injection continues to be one of the most damaging security exploits in terms of personal information exposure as well as monetary loss. Injection attacks are the number one vulnerability in the most recent OWASP Top 10 report, and the number of these attacks continues to increase. Traditional defense strategies often involve static, signature-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) rules which are mostly effective only against previously observed attacks but not unknown, or zero-day, attacks. Much current research involves the use of machine learning techniques, which are able to detect unknown attacks, but depending on the algorithm can be costly in terms of performance. In addition, most current intrusion detection strategies involve collection of traffic coming into the web application either from a network device or from the web application host, while other strategies collect data from the database server logs. In this project, we are collecting traffic from two points: at the web application host, and at a Datiphy appliance node located between the webapp host and the associated MySQL database server. In our analysis of these two datasets, and another dataset that is correlated between the two, we have been able to demonstrate that accuracy obtained with the correlated dataset using algorithms such as rule-based and decision tree are nearly the same as those with a neural network algorithm, but with greatly improved performance.},

abstract = {A web application could be visited for different purposes. It is possible for a web site to be visited by a regular user as a normal (natural) visit, to be viewed by crawlers, bots, spiders, etc. for indexing purposes, lastly to be exploratory scanned by malicious users prior to an attack. An attack targeted web scan can be viewed as a phase of a potential attack and can lead to more attack detection as compared to traditional detection methods. In this work, we propose a method to detect attack-oriented scans and to distinguish them from other types of visits. In this context, we use access log files of Apache (or ISS) web servers and try to determine attack situations through examination of the past data. In addition to web scan detections, we insert a rule set to detect SQL Injection and XSS attacks. Our approach has been applied on sample data sets and results have been analyzed in terms of performance measures to compare our method and other commonly used detection techniques. Furthermore, various tests have been made on log samples from real systems. Lastly, several suggestions about further development have been also discussed.}

abstract="With the ongoing rise and ease-of-use of services provided by major cloud providers, many enterprises migrate their infrastructure and applications to cloud platforms. However, the success of using many and diverse services leads to more attack vectors for potential attackers to exploit, that again leads to more difficult, complex and platform-specific security architectures. This paper is an attempt to remedy this problem by proposing simplified cloud security using machine learning techniques. This leads to a more general architecture that uses classifiers such as decision trees and neural networks, trained with data logged by cloud applications. More specifically, we collected easy-to-interpret access logs from multiple web applications which are often the only kind of security information available on various services on such platforms. The results show a more flexible approach, that was experimentally validated on cloud platforms and improve detection speed, using neural networks and J48 decision trees, up to 26--47 times while still maintaining an accuracy of 98.47{\%} and 97.71{\%} respectively.",
